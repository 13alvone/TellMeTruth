# Fact Check Pipeline

A robust, end-to-end pipeline to fetch video links from email, download media, transcribe audio, and fact-check content using OpenAI’s ChatGPT API.

## Features

- Uses [`gmailtail`](https://github.com/c4pt0r/gmailtail) with OAuth to monitor Gmail for new messages containing video URLs.
- Deduplicates links using SQLite.
- Downloads media from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and more via `yt-dlp`.
- Supports private or age-restricted videos using a `cookies.txt` (exported from your Firefox session).
- Transcribes audio using OpenAI Whisper.
- Fact-checks transcripts using ChatGPT.
- Fully automated with a master script (`run_all_pipeline.sh`) or Docker for reliability.
- Minimal setup friction—just plug in your credentials, generate cookies, and go!

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Server 22+ (or macOS/Linux for development).
- Python 3.10+ (for local/manual mode).
- `ffmpeg` installed (needed by `yt-dlp` and Whisper).
- Gmail OAuth2 client credentials from Google Cloud (`GMAILTAIL_CREDENTIALS`) and the token file generated by gmailtail (`GMAILTAIL_TOKEN`).
- Docker & Docker Compose recommended for reproducible environment.
- Must be logged in to YouTube with Firefox for cookies export (see below).

## Gmail OAuth Setup

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project, and enable the Gmail API.
2. Create an **OAuth client ID** for a Desktop application and download the credentials JSON.
3. Run:

       gmailtail --credentials credentials.json --cached-auth-token token.json --once
       # Use --tail instead of --once if you want gmailtail to keep running.

   Running gmailtail with these options prompts for OAuth and creates `token.json` referenced by `GMAILTAIL_TOKEN`.

---

## Ethical Use & Privacy

- This project is intended for educational and lawful purposes. Only process content you have the right to access and share.
- Downloads and transcripts may include personal data. Handle all files responsibly and remove them when no longer needed.
- Keep your Gmail credentials and the `cookies.txt` export private. Do not commit them to version control; `.gitignore` already excludes `.env` and `cookies.txt`.

## Quick Start: Dockerized Setup (Recommended)

        1. **Clone this repository:**
                git clone https://github.com/youruser/factcheck.git && cd factcheck

        2. **Create Gmail OAuth credentials and authorize gmailtail:**
                - In Google Cloud Console, enable the Gmail API and create an OAuth client ID (Desktop).
                - Download the credentials JSON and save it as `credentials.json` in the project directory.
                - Run `gmailtail --credentials credentials.json --cached-auth-token token.json --once` and follow the OAuth prompt.
                  # Use `--tail` instead of `--once` to keep gmailtail running continuously.
                - Keep both `credentials.json` and `token.json` in this folder so Docker can mount them.

        3. **Log into YouTube in Firefox (with the account you want to use).**
                - Make sure you can play the restricted/private videos in your browser.

        4. **Generate a cookies.txt file:**
                pip3 install browser-cookie3
                python3 dump_firefox_cookies.py
                # This creates ./cookies.txt in your project folder

		[i] If you're running Docker on a different machine, copy cookies.txt to that machine's project directory.

        5. **Copy .env.example to .env and edit your settings:**
                cp .env.example .env
                vim .env    # or use nano, code, etc.

                # Required in .env:
                GMAIL_EMAIL=your@gmail.com
                GMAILTAIL_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials.json
                GMAILTAIL_TOKEN=/app/token.json
                GMAIL_DESIRED_SENDERS=trusted1@example.com,trusted2@icloud.com
                YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE=/app/cookies.txt
        
        6. **Build and start the Docker service:**
                sudo docker-compose up -d --build

        7. **Check logs for activity:**
                sudo docker logs -f tell_me_truth

## Manual Installation (Non-Docker)

        1. Clone and cd to project directory.
        2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
                python3 -m venv venv
                source venv/bin/activate

        3. Install dependencies:
                pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

        4. Create Gmail OAuth credentials and authorize gmailtail:
                gmailtail --credentials credentials.json --cached-auth-token token.json --once  # or --tail for continuous use

        5. Generate cookies as described above and place them in ./cookies.txt.

        6. Export environment variables:
                export GMAIL_EMAIL=your@gmail.com
                export GMAILTAIL_CREDENTIALS=$(pwd)/credentials.json
                export GMAILTAIL_TOKEN=$(pwd)/token.json
                export YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE=$(pwd)/cookies.txt

        7. Run the pipeline scripts:
                python3 email_video_runner.py
                python3 transcribe_downloaded_videos.py
            # The transcriber automatically processes directories listed in
            # `factcheck_dirs_for_transcription.txt` created by the downloader.

---

## Configuration

- Place all variables in `.env` or export in your shell.
- You **must** have a valid `cookies.txt` in your project root for restricted video downloads.
- To change polling interval (in seconds), set `INTERVAL` in `.env`.

        Example .env:

                GMAIL_EMAIL=your@gmail.com
                # OAuth client JSON downloaded from Google Cloud
                GMAILTAIL_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials.json
                # Token generated when gmailtail prompts for OAuth
                # (e.g., run `gmailtail --credentials credentials.json --cached-auth-token token.json --once`)
                GMAILTAIL_TOKEN=/app/token.json
                GMAIL_DESIRED_SENDERS=trusted1@example.com,trusted2@icloud.com
                YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE=/app/cookies.txt
                INTERVAL=3600

---

## Usage

### Manual Execution

	Run downloader:  
		python3 email_video_runner.py

        Run transcriber:
                python3 transcribe_downloaded_videos.py
        # Uses directories listed in `factcheck_dirs_for_transcription.txt`.

### Automated Pipeline

	Run everything on a loop (no cron needed):  
		./run_all_pipeline.sh

### One-Off Run via tmux

        Start a single pipeline cycle in a detached tmux session:
                ./tmux_run_once.sh [session_name]
        Then attach with:
                tmux attach -t [session_name]

### Docker Deployment

	Build image and run container (requires sudo if not in docker group):  
		sudo docker-compose up -d --build

## Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` for its unit tests. Install dependencies and run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pytest

## Troubleshooting

- **OAuth errors:** Verify your `GMAIL_EMAIL`, `GMAILTAIL_CREDENTIALS`, and `GMAILTAIL_TOKEN` paths in `.env`.
- **Download failures:** Ensure `YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE` exists and is readable by the container or Python script.
- **Permission issues:** Check file ownership/permissions on `downloads.db`, `downloads/`, and `cookies.txt`.
- **Docker issues:** Confirm volumes, `.env`, and file paths are correct. Run with `sudo` if needed.
- **Private/restricted video errors:** Regenerate `cookies.txt` from a fresh Firefox login.
